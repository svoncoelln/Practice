Here is the entirety of my favorite album, Slipknot (1999)

**SIC**
Pain!
Enemy, show me what you wanna be
I can handle anything
Even if I can't handle you
Readily, either way it better be
Don't you fuckin' pity me
Get up, Get off
What the hell am I sayin'?
I don't know about malevolent
Sure as hell decadent
I want somebody to step up, step off
Walls! Let me fall! Fuck you all!
Get a grip, don't let me slip 'til I drop the ball
Fuck this shit, I'm sick of it
You're goin' down, this is a war
Fuck it!
Who's the fuck am I to criticize you
Twisted state of mind?
Your leavin' me suspect, I'm leavin' you grotesque
Feels like a burn from which you never learn
Cause and effect, you jealous ass
Press your face against the glass, suffer
Fuck this shit, I'm sick of it
You're goin' down, this is a war
Go!
I've just begun
It's about that time gotta get mine
I've just begun
It's about that time gotta get mine
I've just begun
It's about that time gotta get mine
I've just begun
It's about that time gotta get mine
Yeah!
You can't kill me 'cause I'm already inside you
You can't kill me 'cause I'm already inside you
You can't kill me 'cause I'm already inside you
You can't kill me 'cause I'm already inside you
Sic! Sic! Sic! Sic!

**EYELESS**
Yeah!
Insane, am I the only motherfucker with a brain?
I'm hearing voices but all they do is complain
How many times have you wanted to kill?
Everything and everyone, say you'll do it but never will
You can't see California without Marlon Brando's eyes
You can't see California without Marlon Brando's eyes
You can't see California without Marlon Brando's eyes
I am my father's son
'Cause he's a phantom, a mystery and that leaves me nothing!
How many times have you wanted to die?
It's too late for me, all you have to do is get rid of me
You can't see California without Marlon Brando's eyes
You can't see California without Marlon Brando's eyes
You can't see California without Marlon Brando's eyes
It's all in your head
It's all in my head
It's all in your head
Yeah
I tried, you lied to me for so long
Everywhere I go, there's a sense of it
Freak on my antics and give me a choice
Doesn't matter if I give a shit, it's shit that you give me
You can't see California without Marlon Brando's eyes
You can't see California without Marlon Brando's eyes
You can't see California without Marlon Brando's eyes
It's all in your head
It's all in my head
It's all in your head
Yeah
Do you wanna feel pain? Takin' my name in vain
Caring never felt so lame inside
Anybody else got pride? Do you wanna take my life?
Maybe I'll reverse my ride
Who the fuck are you? Fuck you!
Better suck it up 'cause you bled through
Better get away from me
Stay the fuck away from me
I feel safe, seems you're saved
I feel safe, it seems you're saved
Look me in my brand new eye
Look me in my brand new eye
Look me in my brand new eye
Motherfucker!
Look me in my brand new eye
Look me in my brand new eye
Look me in my brand new eye
Look me in my brand new...

**WAIT AND BLEED**
I've felt the hate rise up in me
Kneel down and clear the stone of leaves
I wander out where you can't see
Inside my shell I wait and bleed
I've felt the hate rise up in me
Kneel down and clear the stone of leaves
I wander out where you can't see
Inside my shell I wait and bleed
GOODBYE!
I wipe it off the tile, the light is brighter this time
Everything is 3-D blasphemy
My eyes are red and gold, the hair is standing straight up
This is not the way I pictured me
I can't control my shakes!
How the hell did I get here?
Something about this, so very wrong
I have to laugh out loud, I wish I didn't like this
Is it a dream or a memory?
I've felt the hate rise up in me
Kneel down and clear the stone of leaves
I wander out where you can't see
Inside my shell I wait and bleed
Get outta my head cuz i don't need this!
Why didn't I see this?
I'm a victim Manchurian Candidate
I have sinned by just
Makin my mind up and takin your breath away
I've felt the hate rise up in me
Kneel down and clear the stone of leaves
I wander out where you can't see
Inside my shell I wait and bleed
I've felt the hate rise up in me
Kneel down and clear the stone of leaves
I wander out where you can't see
Inside my shell I wait and bleed
GOODBYE!
You haven't learned a thing
I haven't changed a thing
The flesh was in my bones
The pain runs always free
You haven't learned a thing
I haven't changed a thing
The flesh was in my bones
The pain runs always free
I've felt the hate rise up in me
Kneel down and clear the stone of leaves
I wander out where you can't see
Inside my shell I wait and bleed
I've felt the hate rise up in me
Kneel down and clear the stone of leaves
I wander out where you can't see
Inside my shell I wait and bleed
Orrrrrhhharhhhhhh
And it waits for you!

**SURFACING**
Fuck you all!
Running out of ways to run
I can't see, I can't be
Over and over and under my skin
All this attention is doing me in!
Fuck it all! fuck this world!
Fuck everything that you stand for!
Don't belong! don't exist!
Don't give a shit!
Don't ever judge me!
Picking through the parts exposed
Taking shape, taking shag
Over and over and under my skin
All this momentum is doing me in!
Fuck it all! fuck this world!
Fuck everything that you stand for!
Don't belong! don't exist!
Don't give a shit!
Don't ever judge me!
And don't you fuckin judge me!
Pain
You got all my love, livin' in your own hate
Drippin' hole man, hard step, no fate
Show you nothin', but I ain't holdin' back
Every damn word I say is a sneak attack
When I get my hands on you
Ain't a fucking thing you can do
Get this 'cause you're never gonna get me
I am the very disease you pretend to be
I am the push that makes you move
I am the push that makes you move
I am the push that makes you move
I am the push that makes you move
Fuck it all! fuck this world!
Fuck everything that you stand for!
Don't belong! don't exist!
Don't give a shit!
Don't ever judge me!
Fuck it all! fuck this world!
Fuck everything that you stand for!
Don't belong! don't exist!
Don't give a shit!
Don't ever judge me!

**SPIT IT OUT**
Since you never gave a damn in the first place,
Maybe it's time you had the tables turned
'Cause in the interest of all involved I got the problem solved
And the verdict is guilty...
...Man nearly killed me
Steppin' where you fear to tread
Stop, drop and roll
You were dead from the git-go!
Big mouthfucker, stupid cocksucker
And if you're scared of me now, then you're dumber than I thought
Always is, and never was
Foundation made of piss and vinegar
Step to me, I'll smear ya
Think I fear ya? Bullshit!
Just another dumb punk chompin' at this tit
Is there any way to break through the noise?
Was it something that I said that got you bent?
Gotta be that way if you want it
Sanity, literal profanity hit me!
Spit it out
All you wanna do is drag me down
All I wanna do is stamp you out
Spit it out
All you wanna do is drag me down
All I wanna do is stamp you out
Maybe it's the way you gotta spread a lotta rumor fodder
Keepin' all your little spies and leaving when you realize
Step up, fairy
I guess it's time to bury your ass with the chrome
Straight to the dome
You heard me right, bitch, I didn't stutter
And if you know what's good, just shut up and beg, brother
Backstab - don't you know who you're dissin'?
Side swipe, we know the Ass that your kissin'
Bigity-biggidy bitch boy, halfway hauser
Don't hear shit cuz It keeps gettin' louder
Come on, and get a face full 'o tactic
Lipping off hard, going home in a basket
You got no pull, no power, no nothin
Now you start shit?
Well, ain't that something?
Payoffs don't protect, and you can hide if you want
But I'll find you, comin' up behind you!
Spit it out
All you wanna do is drag me down
All I wanna do is stamp you out
Spit it out
All you wanna do is drag me down
All I wanna do is stamp you out
'Bout time I set this record straight
All the needlenose punchin' is making me irate
Sick o' my bitchin' fallin' on deaf ears
Where you gonna be in the next five years?
The crew and all the fools, and all the politix
Get your lips ready, gonna gag, gonna make you sick
You got dick when they passed out that good stuff
BAM!
Are you sick of me?
Good enough, had enough!
Fuck me! I'm all out of enemies!
Fuck me! I'm all out of enemies!
Fuck me! I'm all out of enemies!
Fuck me! I'm all out of enemies!
Fuck me! I'm all out of enemies!
Fuck me! I'm all out of enemies!
Fuck me! I'm all out of enemies!
Fuck me! I'm all out of enemas!
Spit it out
All you wanna do is drag me down
All I wanna do is stamp you out
Spit it out
All you wanna do is drag me down
All I wanna do is stamp you out
Spit!
Spit!
Spit!
Spit!
Spit... it out!

**TATTERED AND TORN**
Kill me
Tattered and torn
Something aches
Tattered and torn
Bad things slither
Tattered and torn
My floors are burning down
Tattered and torn
And I can't find a window
Tattered and torn
This is medieval
Tattered and torn
This is cerebral
Tattered and torn
Suffocated
Tattered and torn
Melodramatic
Tattered and torn
Driven to the verge of
Tattered and torn
I make you my enemy
Tattered and torn
The nerves you sever
Tattered and torn
Can serve you better
Tattered and torn
In the blink of an eye
Tattered and torn
In the space of a second
Tattered and torn
Open my wrists
Tattered and torn
Give me my lessons
Tearing myself apart
From the things that make me hurt!
Tearing myself apart
From the things that make me hurt!
Tearing myself apart
From the things that make me hurt!
Tearing myself apart
From the things that make me!
Tearing myself apart
From the things that make me hurt!
Tearing myself apart
From the things that make me hurt!
Tearing myself apart
From the things that make me hurt!
Tearing myself apart
From the things that make me hurt!

**PURITY**
Maze, psychopathic daze, I create this waste
Back away from tangents on the verge of drastic ways
Can't escape this place, I deny your face
Sweat gets in my eyes, I think I'm slowly dying
Put me in a homemade cellar
Put me in a hole for shelter
Someone hear me, please, all I see is hate
I can hardly breathe and I can hardly take it
Hands on my face, overbearing, I can't get out!
Hands on my face, overbearing, I can't...
Lost, run at my own cost, hearing laughter, scoffed
Learning from the rush, detached from such and such
Bleak all around me, weak, listening, incomplete
I am not a dog but I'm the one you're dogging
I am in a buried kennel
I have never felt so final
Someone find me, please, losing all reserve
I'm fucking gone, I think I'm fucking dying
Hands on my face, overbearing, I can't get out!
Hands on my face, overbearing, I can't...
You all stare, but you'll never see
There's something inside me
You all stare, but you'll never see
There's something inside me
You all stare, but you'll never see
There's something inside me
You all stare, but you'll never see
There's something in you I despise!
Cut me, show me, enter
I am willing and able and never any danger to myself
Knowledge in my pain, knowledge in my pain
Or was my tolerance a phase? Empathy, out of my way
I can't die!
I can't die!
I can't die!
I can't die!
You all stare, but you'll never see
There's something inside me
You all stare, but you'll never see
There's something inside me
You all stare, but you'll never see
There's something inside me
You all stare, but you'll never see
There's something in you I despise!
Despise, despise!
Purity!
Purity!
Purity!
Purity!
Purity!
Purity!
Purity!
Purity!

**NO LIFE**
My freedom is best
Whole country's on house arrest
And everyone's a suspect
You can't feel the flow because you died
Face down on a "suicide"
The muthafucker's on self destruct
Nobody guardin' your back it's all a front
Save this! my rage is bliss!
I'm takin' names and gettin' pissed!
Where's chuck d when ya need him?
You ain't shit just a puddle on the
Bed spread
The maniac psycho
Cool j screamed the shit
But I still can't believe it
Man, it's funny that you scare me so
Just enough to fuck me up again and again
Hard life is hard as hell
Better back the fuck on up
'Cause this is
No kind of life! this is no kind of life!
(I've got to get out!)
It's no kind of life! this is no kind of life!
(You can't blame me!)
Can't be real no more
Your mask is skin and bone
Savor every flavor you want 'cause it's not your own
Bad-ass at bat, man
Forget about the battle, it's the war we gotta win
Breathe! amer-cult, breathe! on more - seethe!
Freak like you gotta pair
Won't be my fault
When you're painted in the corner of a no-good life
This is
No kind of life! this is no kind of life!
(I've got to get out!)
It's no kind of life! this is no kind of life!
(You can't blame me!)
I can't remember, I don't understand,
Is it malice that makes you this way?
Carry it with you 'til someone forgives you
I laugh 'cause there's nothing to say
You can't begin to consider the
Palpable hate in the air when you're here
None of us wonder what weather you're under
You're making it perfectly clear!
Lights ain't on, shit ain't right
Never had peace so I had to fight
Can you look in my eyes when my back's against
The wall, slash at my eyes, surprise, you'll never get me
You're all reality and sound bites
And the freedom is never in plain sight
The feelings, the question, the price is too
Human, for fucking sake, this is
No kind of life! this is no kind of life!
(I've got to get out!)
It's no kind of life! this is no kind of life!
(You can't blame me!)

**DILUTED**
I'm cold, I'm ugly
I'm always confused by everything
I can stare into a thousand eyes
But every smile hides a bold-faced lie
It itches, it seethes, it festers and breathes
My heroes are dead, they died in my head
Thin out the herd, squeeze out the pain
Something inside me has opened up again
Thoughts of me exemplified
All the little flaws I have denied
Forget today, forget whatever happened
Everyday I see a little more of overall deficiencies
I'm nothing short of being one complete catastrophe
What the hell did I do to deserve all of this?
What the hell did I do to deserve all of this?
I save all the bullets from ignorant minds
Your insults get stuck in my teeth as they grind
Way past good taste, on our way to bad omens
I decrease, while my symptoms increase
God what the fuck is wrong
You act like you knew it all along
Your timing sucks, your silence is a blessing
All I ever wanted out of you was
Something you could never be
Now take a real good look at
What you've fucking done to me
What the hell did I do to deserve all of this?
What the hell did I do to deserve all of this?
Gimme any reason why I'd need you, boy
Gimme any reason why I'd need you
Gimme any reason why I'd need you
Gimme any reason not to fuck you up
Gimme any reason why I'd need you, bitch
Gimme any reason why I'd need you
Gimme any reason why I'd need you
Gimme any reason not to fuck you up
I see you in me, I see you in me
I see you in me, I see you in me
I see you in me, I see you in me
I see you in me, I see you in me
I keep my scars from prying eyes
Incapable of ever knowing why
Somebody breathe, I've got to have an answer
Why am I so fascinated by
Bigger pictures, better things
But I don't care what you think
You'll never understand me
What the hell did I do to deserve all of this?
What the hell did I do to deserve all of this?
What the hell did I do to deserve all of this?
What the hell did I do to deserve all of this?
Fuck!

**ONLY ONE**
Pain!
Made to order!
Pain!
Made to order!
Pain!
Made to order!
Pain!
I'm not the second coming,
I'm the first wave
Better get an army,
'Cause the fire left me unscathed
You bet your bottom dollar,
I'm the top of the shit pile
So stick around,
'Cause I'll get to you in just a few
Step off the Achtung,
Get back or get stung.
Idiotic sense of yourself,
Are you that dumb?
Entire legion of me,
Totalitarian
The one and only motherfucker,
Top of the world man
'Cause I can't stand it, planned it,
Gonna crash land it
In other words,
Consider me branded
Another version of me,
Another version of you
Both barrels,
What you're gonna do?
All I hear is human noise!
You made your own fucking choice!
I belong to only me!
Silence for my revelry!
I can only die over time!
Filthy hands, stay away from mine!
Every reason is a right to hate!
Painful clutch!
Death is fine, give me mine!
Only one of us walks away!
Only one of us walks away!
Only one of us walks away!
Only one of us walks away!
Somebody explain this!
You don't care 'cause you don't exist!
What the fuck, is this another joke?
Reckoning!
Only one of us walks away!
Only one of us walks away!
Only one of us walks away!
Only one of us walks away!
Only one of us walks away!
Only one of us walks away!
Only one of us walks away!
Only one of us walks away!

**SCISSORS**
I play doctor for five minutes flat
Before I cut my heart open and let the air out
Three bugs, a pound of dust, some wind spilled before me
In the strangest manner that had broke away my tear spout
As I lie there with my tongue spread wide open
A black widow had offered me a sweetheart tube
As I injected the candid heart that I selected
She said don't hesitate, just do what you have to do to me
It's hard to stay between the lines of skin
Just 'cause I have nerves don't mean that I can feel
I wasn't very much fun to be with anyway
Just let the blood run red 'cause I can't feel
It's hard to stay between the lines of skin
Just 'cause I have nerves don't mean that I can feel
I wasn't very much fun to be with anyway
Just let the blood run red 'cause I can't feel
Biding my time until the time is right
Biding my time until the time is right
Biding my time until the time is right
Biding my time, it's time
Biding my time until the time is right
Biding my time until the time is right
Biding my time until the time is right
Biding my time, it's time
Biding my time until the time is right
Biding my time until the time is right
Biding my time until the time is right
Biding my time, it's time
Biding my time until the time is right
Biding my time until the time is right
Biding my time until the time is right
Biding my time, it's time
Biding, biding, biding, biding
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
Someone in behind me
Someone inside me
Everyone against me
Everyone beside me
Clawing away the pieces
Scratching away the abscess
One more, two more
Everyone, once more
One more, two more
Everyone, once more
Inside the faces that I hide from you
I want to see you splayed before me
You are the only one
That I would rather see before me
You want it, you need it
You want it, you need it
You want it, you need it
You want it, you need it
Don't lie; I die, you lie; I lie, oh, why?
I don't want you to pay anyone when I die
I wanna die, I'd rather die, I wanna die
You purge, you burn, you purge
I don't need you anymore, I don't need you
It's time, it's time, it's time, it's time
It's time, it's time, it's time, it's time
It's time, it's time, it's time, it's time

**GET THIS**
I don't like a fucking thing.
Music sucks dick.
Suck the snot end of the tip of my prick.
You fucking cunts!
Get off of my back.
I don't want to do a show with your shitty fucking band.
You suck, they suck,

**EEYORE**
Meet the man that made me
Greet the can that I came from
Oh the fucking sacred heart of Jesus
Blew it in the back room
Feelin' like a real goon
Slam the fuck aside, man
I'm on, you're not
I am the great big mouth
Good riddance, though I'm sad to say
I didn't get to kill you
Rhetoric, better look both ways
I gotta get an arm through
Stain
What the fuck is up? get the fuck away
Run if you want to
Innocent? you're a guilty conscience
Laugh last, break through
Stain
Prepare you fucker
I don't give a shit, bitch
I don't give a fuck, bitch
I don't understand, bitch
You don't matter
I don't give a shit, man
I don't give a fuck, man
I don't really care, man
I'm the super sized man

[Verse: Corey Taylor]
One, two, look out behind you
Bitch, gonna be on all you
Peace suffocates their freedom
This'll better me, a part of me
You were a par and a nag
Thinking that you lost, my friend
It doesn't matter what price, you win
Blood, sweat, and bastard-size
Stare into the killer in your eyes!
[Pre-Chorus: Corey Taylor]
Besiege me! I kiss your cancer
Deceiving, this doesn't matter
Becoming degraded dated
Behind me, one more I swear I'm gonna…

[Chorus 2: Corey Taylor Clown, & both]
Gonna snap (gonna snap)
I'm gonna snap (gonna snap)
I'm gonna snap (gonna snap)
I'm gonna snap (gonna snap)
